#Resistors #Ω #Ohms

Resistance is measured in units of Ohms (Ω). Resistors limits or regulates the flow of currents within an electronic circuit.

| Ohms Value | Simplified Value
| - | - |
| 1MΩ | 1000kΩ |
|1kΩ | 1000Ω |

| Red Ring Count | Resistance Provided |
| - | - |
| 1 | 10KΩ |
| 2 | 220Ω |
| 0 | 1KΩ |

**Ohms Law**
$$
I = V / R
$$

$$
Current = Voltage / Resistance
$$

$$
Current = 5V / 10kΩ = 0.5mA
$$
