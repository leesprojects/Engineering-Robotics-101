## LEDs
#Leds #Polar #Diode

A type of diode (polar, one way) which only works if the current is flowing in the correction direction where the positive (longer) pin is connective to the positive output and the negative output (shorter grounder) pin to the ground

| LED | Voltage | Max Current | Rec Current
| - | - | - | - |
| Red | 1.9-2.2V | 20mA | 10mA|
| Green | 2.9-3.4V | 10mA | 5mA|
|Blue | 2.9-3.4V | 10mA | 5mA|
